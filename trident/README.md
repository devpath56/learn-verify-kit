# Trident

**A three-prong quality harness for AI work — portable, zero-dependency, install-anywhere.**

Trident wraps any working session in three prongs that hold each other honest:

- **Do-er** (Opus) — does the task.
- **Simba** — loyal to *you*. Reads only your messages, holds your intent, and catches the moment the
  Do-er starts to drift or forget a must-have — before it ships.
- **Auditor** (Fable) — judges the output with **deterministic evaluators first**, a rubric-based
  LLM-judge second. A different model from the Do-er, so it never grades its own work.

The shaft that binds the three: a **failures log** — one JSONL source of truth. Every real mistake is
logged once, turned into a check that stops it recurring, and surfaced to you. Work quality compounds.

> Modeled on [Arize Phoenix](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix)'s eval shapes (trace → evaluate → curate
> failures → iterate) so it's grounded in a real framework and forward-compatible with a live Phoenix
> deployment — while staying pure-skill and running with zero setup in claude.ai, Cowork, and Claude Code.

## Status
**Skeleton for review.** The architecture is in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md); skill files and
references are stubbed to its contract. Deep logic and the full failures-log migration follow design sign-off.

## Layout
```
ARCHITECTURE.md              the design doc (read this first)
.claude/skills/
  trident/    SKILL.md        orchestrator + the `log failure` SSOT trigger
  auditor/    SKILL.md        Fable judge — deterministic evaluators first
  simba/      SKILL.md        your-intent guardian
  references/                 house-rules, loop-contract, evaluators, phoenix-protocol, failures-log
failures/
  failures.jsonl              the SSOT (sanitized, committed)
  schema.json                 record schema
  FAILURES.md                 generated human view (do not hand-edit)
tests/
  regression-cases.md         one case per guard, from a real failure
```

## The one discipline
Every guard exists only because of a real, observed failure — and maps to a check that stops that exact
failure recurring. The failures log only ever grows from real errors.
