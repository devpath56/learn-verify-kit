# Phoenix protocol — the eval shapes Trident borrows (SKELETON)

We are pure-skill, so Trident does **not execute** `phoenix.evals`. It adopts Arize Phoenix's *shapes*
so that (a) the design is grounded in a real, current eval framework rather than invented, and (b) the
same records pipe into a live Phoenix instance later with no reshaping (the optional Python harness,
out of scope by the pure-skill decision).

## The four Phoenix capabilities → Trident equivalents
| Phoenix | Trident equivalent |
|---|---|
| **Tracing** (OTel/OpenInference spans: input, output, status, error, tokens) | the Do-er's `Spans`; the CF `trace` field |
| **Evaluation** (code-based / LLM-based / human-label evaluators) | the Auditor's deterministic+structural / Fable-judge / your approval |
| **Datasets** (curate failure cases) | `failures.jsonl` — the curated failure SSOT |
| **Experiments** (run evaluators over a dataset) | re-running detectors over the SSOT as a regression suite (`tests/`) |

## The loop is the same loop
Phoenix: **trace → evaluate → curate failures into a dataset → iterate on prompts.**
Trident: Do-er traces → Auditor evaluates → new failure logged to the SSOT → guards/detectors iterate.

## Span shape (OpenInference-compatible)
A CF `trace` entry — `{span, note, role}` — is a reduced OpenInference span. The `role: root|error|ok`
marks the root-cause and error spans, matching your existing `⊘ root / ⚠ error` convention. This is
deliberately a strict subset of the OpenInference schema so a future exporter is a field-rename, not a rewrite.

> TODO after approval: the exact field map from a CF `trace` entry to an OpenInference span, and the
> minimal exporter contract for the optional Python harness.
