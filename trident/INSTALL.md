# Install Trident

Trident is a pure skill bundle — no build, no dependencies, no hooks. Install = make the
`.claude/skills/` tree visible to your Claude surface.

## Claude Code (CLI / VS Code) — global skill
Clone the repo and point Claude Code at its skills, or copy the bundle into your user skills dir:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devpath56/trident-setup.git
# then either work inside the repo, or install globally:
cp -R trident-setup/.claude/skills/{trident,auditor,simba,references} ~/.claude/skills/
```

Invoke with: **"run trident"**, **"audit this work"**, **"watch my intent on this"**, or the
always-on **"log failure"** trigger. In VS Code, the Claude Code extension picks up
`~/.claude/skills/` the same way.

## claude.ai / Cowork
Upload the `.claude/skills/` tree (or the repo) as a skill bundle. The skills load with zero setup.
Note the surface difference below.

## The failures log — one SSOT across sessions
`log failure` (and variants: "log fail", "log this failure", "record failure") appends the next
`CF-###` to **`failures/failures.jsonl` in this repo** and commits + pushes it. For that to work in a
session, **this repo must be in the session's scope** (add it if not). Every session then writes to
the same canonical file.

| Surface | `log failure` behavior |
|---|---|
| Claude Code / repo session | full loop; SSOT is the git file; append → Auditor-approve → commit + push |
| claude.ai / Cowork | degrades to the connected copy / chat; the canonical file stays the repo's |

Personal specifics never enter the committed record — they go to `failures.local.jsonl` (gitignored).

## Verify the install
Ask: **"run trident on <some work>"** — you should see the loop (Simba IntentCard → Do-er → Auditor
Verdict) reference the failures-log detectors. Ask **"log failure"** on a real mistake — you should
get back `logged CF-### (<title>)`.
